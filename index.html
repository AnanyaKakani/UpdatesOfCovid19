      <h1>What is corona virus?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
        in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
        to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
        severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
        discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
        before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</h5>

      <h1>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
(about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
attention.  </h5>

      <h1>How does COVID-19 spread?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
person who is sick. 
<h1>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? </h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly
transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than
through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19
spread?”

      <h1>What are the precautions for COVID-19?</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32" style="text-align:left;">1.Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maybe to the tune of happy birthday, or perhaps you could try singing one of your favourite songs to see which last for 20 seconds instead!
 <br> 2.Try to keep your hands off your face, so no rubbing your eyes or nose, or putting your hands in your mouth. That way, if there is any of the virus on your hands, you won’t give it a way to enter the body where it can make you feel unwell
<br>3. If you cough or sneeze, do this into a tissue and bin it. You could also sneeze into your elbow if needed to avoid using your hands
<br>4. Wearing face masks or face coverings is required in many indoor environments to help protect you and those around you. Find out more about where you need to wear a face covering here
<br>5. Practice social distancing</h5>
